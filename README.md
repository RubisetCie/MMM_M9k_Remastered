# M9k Remastered

**Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169649722**

# Description:

M9k: Remastered is a massive improvement over the original M9k addons.

The original code was scrapped and replaced with new modern code for maximum performance.

<br>

This addon includes all original base packs:

- Small arms, heavy weapons, assault rifles, specialties pack.


This addon can be used exclusively for the resources:

- Models, materials, sounds, etc..

# Compatibility

M9k: Remastered is **not** compatible with original/legacy M9k addons.

Weapons and packs have to be coded specifically for M9k: Remastered to function properly.

**All non-M9k: Remastered packs have to be removed.**

# Console Commands:

Most of these commands can only be used through the **server console**.

Commands | Description | ⠀ | ⠀
:--|:--|:--|:--
m9k_balancemode | Remastered balance	| 0 = Legacy | 1 = Remastered
m9k_spawn_with_ammo | Ammo in magazine	| 0 = No ammo | 1 = Full magazine on equip
m9k_spawn_with_reserve | Giving ammo on pickup	| 0 = No ammo | 1 = 3 Magazines on equip
m9k_zoomstages | Zoom-stages on weapons	| 0 = One zoom level | 1 = Multiple zoom levels
m9k_zoomtoggle | Zoom-toggle on weapons	| 0 = Hold to zoom | 1 = Toggle to zoom/un-zoom
m9k_lefthanded | Left-handed weapons | 0 = Right-handed | 1 = Left-handed

**More commands will be added later.**

# Roleplaying:

If you're using M9k: Remastered on your roleplay server we recommend running the following commands:

- m9k_balancemode 1
- m9k_spawn_with_ammo 0
- m9k_spawn_with_reserve 0

With these commands, weapons will spawn without a magazine and won't give the player ammo when picking them up.

The remastered balanced is recommended for a more engaging balance, but is optional.

# Features:

- Drastically improved code that runs a lot faster and includes countless of bug fixes.
- Dynamic weapon accuracy imitating recoil behavior from CS:S.
- Balance switch that allows you to use the legacy or remastered weapon balance.
- You can un-scope by pressing the reload key. Holding it will reload the weapon.
- c_hands are simulated wherever possible through code.
- Immersive sound handler. Every sound the gun makes is played for everyone else. (Deploy sounds, reload sounds, etc..)
- Adjusted firing sound volumes. Silenced Weapons are actually silenced and sniper rifles are loud.. etc..
